Convolutional neural networks are special type of neural network that is used for modeling data with strong spatial correlations such as images, multivariate time-series, earth science studies (seismic classification and regression) among many other applications. Convolutional networks have gone under significant changes since 1998 and in this series of articles I aim to reproduce famous model architecture champions such as LeNet, AlexNet, Resnet etc. I am by no means an expert in the field of computer vision. My aim is to share my findings and studies with the wider audiences and deliver reproducible Python notebooks.
